The Good:

- I am able to grasp the concepts pretty well, and am able to understand what needs to be built in order for the feature to function properly.

The Bad:

- Sometimes I get lost with all the back and forth between the different files on the frontend;
- Had a few errors that took me plenty of time to solve them, that ended up being simple things;
- Practicing more would help me preventing the last 2 points, it is frustrating losing so much time in a challenge like this;
- My styling skills are still close to none, need to study on this so I can make my web apps more appealing;
- Still need to understand better in which step to fetch data, I tend to use `pages` to design a page by importing all the components and put them together. With this I fetch data in the component itself, but in certain situations, the app required me to fetch directly onto the page.

The Ugly:

- The core functionality of the 'Add Heart' feature works, but looks very weird, I struggled to find a solution to make it perfect. Since it was - in a way - working, I decided to move on to other features and come back later if I have the time.
- Feature 4 is not complete, and the value on the input field had a weird behaviour right now. I've seen it working and not working without changing the code.
